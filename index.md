This is the home for the [TTS Accessibility Guildâ€™s](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/#accessibility) training content. 

The guild has developed a series of training sessions to help product teams understand digital accessibility and develop reliable, routine testing practices beyond running automated scans. This training is not meant to be a substitute for thorough accessibility auditing of digital products. However, these materials serve as a solid introduction to accessibility concepts and as a pragmatic approach to accessibility testing that any member of a product team can perform regularly. 

## 8-session training approach

The following table contains a listing with links to the slide decks for the training modules which, when run in a series, provide the foundation for successful manual accessibility testing. Each session is intended to be approximately one hour in length with one to two hours of independent or paired "homework" after each. With this setup, we prefer to hold one session per week, although the sessions could be condensed into a single week if needed.
